They can perform a physical examination, ask you more detailed questions about your symptoms and medical history, and order tests if necessary to determine the exact cause of your headache and high temperature.\n\nI've gone ahead and scheduled an appointment for you with Dr. Emily Carter on Tuesday, April 15, 2024, at 11 am.
